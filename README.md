## Hi there. Welcome to My GitHub Profile! ðŸ‘‹

I primarily use Bitbucket for my professional work, so what youâ€™ll find here on GitHub are mostly experimental projects and things Iâ€™m exploring in my free time. Feel free to browse around and check out what Iâ€™m working on, but keep in mind that this is where I test new ideas and technologies.

If you're interested in seeing more polished, production-level work, or connecting further, feel free to check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kdrbek).
